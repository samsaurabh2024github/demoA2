            It supports collaboration, experimentation through branching, and contributes to cleaner project workflows.

        <h3>Quick Git Tip</h3>
        <p>
            Always create a new branch before starting any major changes. This keeps your main branch clean and reduces the chance of conflicts.
            Use: <code>git checkout -b feature-branch</code> to create and switch to a new branch.
